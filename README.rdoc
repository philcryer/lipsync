= lipsync

A lightweight service that provides automated file synchronization between multiple hosts.

lipsync is an open source, lightweight service that provides automated two-way, {Dropbox}[http://bit.ly/1IGiJu]-like file synchronization in Linux by utilizing {OpenSSH}[http://www.openssh.com/], {rsync}[http://rsync.samba.org/], and {lsyncd}[http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/]. lipsync is a realization of a popular blog post of mine named {HOWTO build your own open source Dropbox clone}[http://fak3r.com/2009/09/14/howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone/]. Since I made the posting I've received a great deal of interest, and had time to test and architect a workable solution. Thanks to everyone that read, commented and encouraged the further development of this idea!

The basic idea and example of a working system can be seen {here}[https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/raw/master/docs/diagram.png].

== Features
- automatic file synchronization from multiple clients to a central server
- two way syncing with changes tracked and propagated to the clients by the server (Dropbox style)
- transfers secured and tunneled through OpenSSH
- safe for everyday use
- low fat

== Dependencies
To get started with lipsync you need at least a client and a server, preferably on multiple systems. Software requirements:
- Server - Linux 2.6.x, rsync (client), opensshd (server)
- Client - Linux 2.6.x, rsync (client), openssh (client), lsyncd

== Mailing list
The mailing list for the lipsync project is hosted on Google Groups, signup {here}[https://groups.google.com/group/project-lipsync].

== Getting started
    git clone git@github.com:philcryer/lipsync.git
    cd lipsync
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

After that, see the docs/INSTALL file or online, {INSTALL}[https://github.com/philcryer/lipsync/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.rdoc#readme] for full documentation.

== Caveats
Much of the initial feedback I received asked for a graphical user interface and support for Windows. Please know that I have attempted neither, instead deciding to focus on the basic server-side functionality. This allowed me to flesh out the architecture, deciding on all the options and understanding ways to improve the transfer performance. Since most of the software used for lipsync is cross-platform, I'd be interested in working with others that want to build a gui front end to talk to the the lipsync backend service. I've been interested in the work done on the {SparkleShare}[http://sparkleshare.org/] project, and since it can use different backends I'm hopeful that it will be agnostic enough to adapt to use lipsync.
